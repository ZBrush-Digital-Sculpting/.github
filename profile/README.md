## What is ZBrush?

**ZBrush** stands as the industry's premier digital sculpting software, revolutionizing the way artists create 3D models. It combines 3D/2.5D modeling, texturing, and painting into a single powerful application. Unlike traditional polygon modeling software, ZBrush uses a proprietary "pixol" technology that stores lighting, color, material, and depth information for all objects on the screen, allowing for an intuitive and fluid sculpting experience.

With ZBrush, artists and designers can:
- Create incredibly detailed and organic models with millions of polygons.
- Utilize a vast array of brushes designed specifically for digital sculpting.
- Streamline workflows for character creation, VFX, and 3D printing.

The software is the gold standard in fields like **film production**, **video game development**, and **collectibles design**. By providing tools that mimic working with real clay, it empowers artists to bring their most imaginative concepts to life with unprecedented detail and freedom. Its powerful feature set, including DynaMesh, ZRemesher, and NanoMesh, makes it an indispensable tool for 3D artists worldwide, from hobbyists to major studios like Industrial Light & Magic and Weta Digital.
